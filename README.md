## 3️⃣ How to Run
Open `Hotel_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab, place `hotel.csv` in same folder, install `pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly`, then run all cells to clean data, perform EDA, and export results.

## 4️⃣ Key Findings
- Peak bookings: June–August.  
- Higher cancellations for early/last-minute bookings.
